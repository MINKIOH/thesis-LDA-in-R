# Latent Dirichlet Allocation in R

This repository contains the code of my 2012 thesis (http://epub.wu.ac.at/3558/1/main.pdf).

Folders:

- `application-pnas`: `LaTex`/`Sweave`/`R` code of the main part of the thesis. Also included are the PNAS abstracts corpus and metadata in `tm` format.
- `dirichlet`: `Sweave`/`R` code to generate figures of the beta and Dirichlet distributions
- `web-scraping`: a `Python`/Scrapy/`R` project to web-scrape a corpus of PNAS journal abstracts
